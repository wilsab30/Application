  def before_coding
  <li>
    I have been exploring various fields of business and law from inside and around the tech industry. the deeper and closer I got into and to tech the more I liked it. until I decided to make my moves: I moved to the US, and moved on from a career in law to pursue a career in software development.

  def while_coding

    I loose track of time. seriously. I still can't believe how lucky I am to have found this chocolate-golden ticket to belong to those who do what they love and love what they do. I feel delightfully challenged when I do back-end design and relaxingly pleased when I manage to design an engaging front end experience for different kinds of users.

  def before_and_after_coding_hours
  <li>
    I am a mother of two young, creative, happy, energetic little ones, who make me happy, challenge and inspire me in every aspect of my life. sharing my life with them is a constant loving reminder for me to never stop being playful, never stop asking questions and exploring, and that hands on experience is the best (and most fun!) way to learn. I also enjoy cooking, yoga, and exploring new places ðŸŽ’.
