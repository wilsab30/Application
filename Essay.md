Step 3: Essay Questions
============================


1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
-----------------------------

 Putting my career on hold during the past couple of years, in favor of relocating to the U.S. and being a full time mother of a baby and a toddler, gave me a chance to look back and realize that being an attorney is not a career I wish to pursue any longer. 
 What do I want to do? 
 Looking back, as an attorney I enjoyed having a full plate of information which I managed to simplify into very clear combination of definitions and conditions that formed an elegant, shorter than expected, contract. In fact I liked it so much that I came up with an idea for software that would really take things up to the next level for contract drafting. Maybe one day… soon!  

 I want a career that will get the best out of what I want to get out of me – creating elegant simplified creative solutions to different challenges. 

 What have I done to expose myself to programming so far? In the little time that I have, I log on to code academy – mainly focused on exploring Python and Java. I like doing it and it comes more naturally to me than what I expected! :) 


2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?
-----------------------------

*   2016-2017
    * Becoming a software developer, most preferably by attending ADA Developers Academy.   
 
*   2017-2020
    * Getting to know a lot about very little:     
I want to work in a well-established company, where I expect to find my niche in software development and sharpen my skills to the point of developing an expertise.  

*   2021 and on
    * Getting to know little about a lot:     
I want to be a part of a small startup company in order to get the opportunity to become a significant part of a core team of a startup company and contribute in any way I can, mainly from the software development point of view.  

   

3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?
-----------------------------

 In 2012, I worked for a company named Aeronautics as a team leader, an executive assistant of the project division VP and as a junior attorney in the legal department. 
That was an extraordinary opportunity to be exposed to anything and everything. However, that year Aeronautics had to significantly downsize their workforce. 
  
 I let my fear of being made redundant take over my confidence in who I was, how essential my role was and how good I was at it - and started to look for another job. 
When I informed my manager that I am leaving he informed me that I was not on ‘the list’ and offered me a very generous raise in order for me to stay. I didn’t stay, and till this day I feel there was so much more for me to accomplish there. 
  
 Eventually I got a 'closure' by sharing the lesson I learned with a friend who faced a similar situation and already started looking for another job when we talked. I told her that she should approach her manager and tell her she wants to help through this difficult time and ask for more responsibilities. She took my advice and got promoted.


4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.
-----------------------------

 I guess this might not be the answer you expect but the most significant thing I taught myself (and still am) is how to be a mother. 
  
 It stretched my boundaries beyond any point I ever imagined, in a great way. It is the most challenging as well as the most rewarding 'job' I have ever had.
     
 As with many other things, I used online information daily and quickly became known as the 'walking baby encyclopedia' among my friends… but ultimately, there isn't actually any other way to profoundly master it but ‘on the job training’. Nothing can replace trying to figure out things by yourself, and building up confidence in your abilities as you experience small successes. You discover the 'algorithm' that is the right one for your child (and fine-tune it daily), composed of proactive guidance applied with compassionate determination, positive and negative feedback, and a whole lot of patience and attention. 
   
 My verbal and non-verbal communications skills got sharpened, my empathy and sympathy got upgraded to HD resolution, my multi-tasking capacities tripled, and – 
My confidence in the fact that I can do anything I'm motivated enough to do no matter how challenging it is - sky rocked.
